<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

### General Background
Rizpa Stock Exchange (shortly RSE) name is a reference to old stock market's stock exchanging method where traders used to stand in room (called "Trading Floor" - Rizpa in Hebrew translated to floor) and announce which stock is being traded and who is selling it. In the modern age where technology involves at a frequent rate, the stock markets transferred  it's exchanging systems into electronic ones, and this academic project tries to partially clone some of them.

### Project's Structure
RSE developed in 3 parts:

1.  Developed a console application where users could "talk" with our system by series of menus and available operations.
2.  Developed a desktop application (via JavaFX architecture) which included a graphic UI on JavaFX components. Each interaction with user were based on different buttons and controllers.
3.  Developed a web application (**this part is mainly covered in this readme, other parts won't be supported here**) which allowed users to dynamically register to system and suggested various operations - issue new stock/buy & sell stocks/deposit cash to system and more.

### On a Personal Note
This project was one of the first time I experienced working in client/server structure, developing a web application and implementing HTTP requests & responses. 
The project summarized  all the subjects that were taught about java & web development. Working on a project from 0 was challenging yet very awarding especially when parts started to connect and form a complete system.

### Built With

* [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/)
* [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

* URL
  ```sh
  TBA
  ```
  
<div id="protocol"></div>   
  
### System Operations Protocol
In order to issue a new command in system, command structure must be in the following order:  
<p align="center"><b>[TYPE] [SYMBOL] [AMOUNT] [SELLING/BUYING] [PRICE]</b></p><br/>



**TYPE:**  
  
RSE system supports the following command types (case sensitive) -
* LMT - Defines limit to stock's price (to/from price) in the command.
 
  > LMT GIT 100 BUYING/SELLING 100 - will buy/sell 100 stocks of GIT, each in price up to/from 100$.

* MKT - Operate this command ASAP (buy/sell in the available  price).
 
  > MKT GIT 100 BUYING/SELLING - will buy/sell 100 stocks of GIT, each in available price in market.

* FOK - Similar to LMT, but the operation must be fully operated or else will be discarded.
 
  > FOK GIT 100 BUYING/SELLING 100 - will buy/sell 100 stocks of GIT, each in price up to/from 100$.  
  > If not all stocks bought/sold, the operation will be discarded.

* IOC - Similar to LMT, but if operation not fully operated it's remaining are discarded.
  > FOK GIT 100 BUYING/SELLING 100 - will buy/sell 100 stocks of GIT, each in price up to/from 100$.  
  > If not all stocks bought/sold, the remaining of the operation will be discarded.
 
 **SYMBOL:** The symbol of the stock (case sensitive).  
 **AMOUNT:** How many stocks in total to sell/buy.  
 **SELLING/BUYING:** Indicates if the command is either selling or buying (case sensitive).  
 **PRICE:** Applies only to LMT type commands. Indicates the price of each stock in command.
